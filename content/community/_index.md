# Apache {{< project-label >}} Team

A successful project requires many people to play many roles. Some write code, others provide project mentorship, and
still others author documentation. General contributors provide valuable feedback, submitting patches and suggestions.

The team consists of Project Management Committee Members, Committers, and Contributors.

## Project Management Committee Members

Project Management Committee Members are volunteers who responsible for leading the project. PMC members cast binding
votes on project direction and software releases.

## Committers

Committers are the group of volunteers who are responsible for the technical aspects of the Apache NiFi Project. This
group has write access to the appropriate source repositories. All committer input is valued. When technical discussions
occur, committer input is treated the same as PMC member input. Committers are encouraged to vote on releases and
technical discussions, but committer votes are not binding on project decisions.

Membership as a Committer is by invitation only and must be approved by consensus approval of the active Apache NiFi PMC
members on a vote open for at least 72 hours. A Committer is considered inactive by their own declaration. Membership
can be revoked by a unanimous vote of all the active PMC members, except the member in question if they are a PMC
member.
