# Features

MiNiFi - a subproject of Apache NiFi - is a complementary data collection approach that supplements the core tenets of
NiFi in dataflow management, focusing on the collection of data at the source of its creation.

Apache NiFi MiNiFi provides the following features:

- Small size and low resource consumption
- Central management of agents
- Generation of data provenance with full chain of custody of information
- Integration with NiFi for follow-on dataflow management

MiNiFi functions in the role of an agent acting immediately at, or directly adjacent to, source sensors, systems, or
servers.
