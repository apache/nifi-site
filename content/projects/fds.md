# Apache {{< project-label >}} Flow Design System

<p class="description">
  A subproject of Apache NiFi to provide a consistent user experience across the various web applications within the NiFi ecosystem.
</p>

## Features

Flow Design System&mdash;a subproject of Apache NiFi&mdash; is an atomic reusable platform for providing a consistent
set of UI/UX components for Apache NiFi, Apache NiFi Registry, Apache NiFi MiNiFi, and any other open source web
applications to consume.

Specific goals for the initial thrust of the Flow Design System effort include:

- Implementation of the Flow Design System for reuseable UI/UX components
- Integration with NiFi Registry UI/UX via npm public registry

Future efforts may include capabilities to support additional UI/UX concepts as they are identified by the community.
