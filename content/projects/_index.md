    <h3>MiNiFi</h3>
    <div class="uk-margin-top">
MiNiFi supports data collection from the point of origin. It is a complementary data collection approach that
supplements the core tenets of NiFi in dataflow management, focusing on the collection of data at the source of its
creation. MiNiFi functions in the role of an agent for source sensors, systems, or servers. MiNiFi provides the
following features:

- Small size and low resource consumption
- Central management of agents
- Generation of data provenance with full chain of custody of information
- Integration with NiFi for follow-on dataflow management

across one or more instances of NiFi or MiNiFi. Registry provides the following features:

- Implementation of a Flow Registry for storing and managing versioned flows
- Integration with NiFi to allow storing, retrieving, and upgrading versioned flows from a Flow Registry
