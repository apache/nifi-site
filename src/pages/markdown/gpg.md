# Apache NiFi Release Signatures and Code Signing

The purpose of this document is to capture and describe the steps involved in generating and verifying cryptographic signatures of official releases of Apache NiFi, as well as configuring cryptographic signatures of individual code commits.  It is written for contributors, committers, and users of Apache NiFi (and related applications).

## <a name="terms">Terms</a>

 * **Asymmetric Cryptography** - a type of cryptography which relies on *key pairs* -- a *public* and *private* key which are mathematically-related such that no other component key matches. This cryptography offers the following actions: **encrypt**, **decrypt**, **sign**, and **verify**
 * **Cryptographic Signature** - a series of bytes which are the result of a signing operation such that only the possessor of a specific private key could have generated this signature. A valid signature indicates that the possessor of said key performed the operation (non-repudiable)
 * **GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG)** - an open-source implementation of encryption software compatible with the OpenPGP standard specified by [RFC 4880][rfc4880]
 * **Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)** - an encryption program written by Phil Zimmermann to provide cryptographic protection (via confidentiality and integrity/authenticity) over data. It follows the OpenPGP standard as specified by [RFC 4880][rfc4880]

## <a name="variable-reference-substitutions">Variable Reference Substitutions</a>

Throughout this guide, references must be made to names and values that will vary from release to release.  For clarity
those variable values have been written like Bash variable references.  When a term like
"```/tmp/src/nifi-${NIFI_VERSION}```" is seen in an instruction or email template it should be replaced with
"```/tmp/src/nifi-1.7.0```" when working the release of "Apache NiFi 1.7.0".

 * Substitutions used in tasks and email templates
    <pre>
    Reference            Example value       Description
    =========            ==============      ===========
    ${BRANCH}            master              the development branch on which the release is based.
    ${NIFI_VERSION}      1.7.0               the version currently in development on the release branch.
    ${NEXT_VERSION}      1.8.0-SNAPSHOT      the future version for development on the release branch.
    ${JIRA_TICKET}       NIFI-2112           the JIRA ticket created by the release manager for the release tasks.
    ${RC}                2                   the Release Candidate index start at 1 for the first release candidate.
    ${RC_TAG_COMMIT_ID}                      the 40 byte commit ID of the RC tag created during the Maven release process.
    ${STAGING_REPO_ID}   orgapachenifi-1088  the temporary repository ID where staged artifacts have been placed.
    ${RM_USERID}         johndoe             the Apache account ID of Release Manager.
    ${RELEASE_TAG}       rel/nifi-1.7.0      the Git repository tag for the source code as released.
    ${VOTE_THREAD_URL}   [1.7.0 vote thread][070-rc2-vote]   the URL for the Apache Pony Mail archive of the release vote thread.
    </pre>

    _To be practical but avoid confusion with future release details, these example values reflect the previous release
NiFi 1.7.0 RC2 release details._

*NOTE: The next version should be the next minor version if the release is based on a major version development branch (e.g master
or 0.x). The next version should be the next incremental version if the release is based on a minor version development branch (e.g
support/nifi-1.1.x or support/nifi-0.7.4). If this is the first incremental release (e.g. 1.2.1) for a minor release line the support
branch may need to be created.*

## <a name="download-gpg">Download GPG</a>

To get started, you should download the appropriate software for your operating system (links and version compatibility as of July 10, 2018). Follow the configuration instructions that come with your tool of choice:

### Mac OS X / macOS

* [GPG Suite][gpg-suite] -- macOS 10.9+ -- a GUI-based suite of GPG tools including command-line tool, Mail client integration, etc. 
* gpg via brew -- distribution of [GnuPG][gnupg] command-line tool via [brew][brew]. Install via `brew update && brew install gpg2`. You may also need `gpg-agent` depending on your system. 

### Linux
* Redhat/CentOS -- `yum install gnupg`
* Debian/Ubuntu -- `apt-get install gnupg`

### Windows
* [Gpg4win][gpg4win] -- Windows 7+ -- a GUI-based suite of GPG tools

## <a name="setting-up-your-key">Setting up your key</a>

*All following commands will use the command-line syntax to perform these operations unless otherwise noted. For instructions on performing these operations in a GUI-environment, refer to the resources listed above.*

To begin, run the `gpg` command with the `--gen-key` or `--full-generate-key` flag. You will be prompted for various information, and can accept the defaults other than **name** and **email**. The tool will prompt for a passphrase, and the key pair will be identified by the **user id** (**name** + **email**) and a **key fingerprint**. 

Example:

```
# Generate the key
ðŸ”“ 0s @ 15:06:19 $ gpg --gen-key
Note: Use "gpg --full-generate-key" for a full featured key generation dialog.

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: NiFi Test User
Email address: test@nifi.apache.org
You selected this USER-ID:
    "NiFi Test User <test@nifi.apache.org>"

Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

```

You now have a key generated for your identity. Some Apache users will include "(CODE SIGNING KEY)" after their name to separate this key from other keys they use. This is optional. By default, keys use 2048 bit length. You can increase this to 4096 bits by using the `--full-generate-key` or `--default-new-key-algo rsa4096` flags when generating. 

The **key fingerprint** can be referred to by the last 8 hex digits (**short ID**) or last 16 hex digits (**long ID**), so for the remainder of this guide, our example key will have the **long ID** `7145 6940 555D B64A` (spaces optional) and **short ID** `555D B64A`, which we can reference in commands as `0x555DB64A`.  

### Trust vs. Validity

It is important to understand the difference between two closely related concepts -- **trust** and **validity**. Validity is how much *you* trust a *key*; that is *how well you have verified the key represents who it claims*. Trust (sometimes referred to as **ownertrust**) is how much transitive trust you give to that entity; how well do you believe *Person X* verifies keys that *they* sign? 

There are four levels of **trust** and five levels of **validity**. 

**Trust**
1. `unknown` -- you do not know how well the owner verifies keys
1. `none` -- you do not trust the owner to verify keys
1. `marginal` -- you trust the owner to verify keys
1. `full` -- you trust the owner to verify keys as well or better than you do

**Validity** 
1. `unknown` -- you do not know whether to trust this key
1. `never`/`none` -- you do not trust this key
1. `marginal` -- you have lightly verified that this key belongs to the owner
1. `full` -- you have verified that this key belongs to the owner
1. `ultimate` -- you have no doubt that this key belongs to the owner (likely because you generated it)

Your generated key is granted `ultimate` trust by default, because you just generated it. See [Web of Trust][web-of-trust] and [GNU Privacy Handbook][gnu-privacy-handbook] for more information and helpful diagrams. 

## <a name="publish-your-key">Publish your key</a>

To allow other users to encrypt data with your key, verify signatures made by your key, etc., you should publish your **PUBLIC** key. *Never share your **PRIVATE** (sometimes referred to as **SECRET**) key*. You can publish your public key to a *key server*, post it on your website, etc. The tools provide multiple ways to perform this task via `--export` and `--send-keys`. Refer to the references above for more information on this process. 

```

```

## <a name="import-another-gpg-key">Import another GPG key</a>

For the key ecosystem to function, you'll want to import other public keys. These can come from key servers, public keys encoded as ASCII sent directly to you, or `KEYS` files posted on servers (such as [https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/nifi/KEYS](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/nifi/KEYS)).

```

## <a name="verify-a-key">Verify a key</a>

When you first import an external key, the key is untrusted (**validity** level `never`). To mark a key as trusted, you will perform *key verification*, either *directly* or via *web of trust*. 

### Direct Verification

For entities you can contact directly via a trusted mechanism (voice call, in-person, etc.), you can exchange the **key fingerprint** personally and verify that the fingerprint they present matches what you have imported. Once verified, you can sign the key. Here I am imitating another user, using a previously-generated key (`0x2F7DEF69`) to sign the "imported" key that was generated above. 

```

```

### Web of Trust

If it is infeasible to contact the key bearer directly, you can delegate that trust to a third-party who you already trust. For example, if you cannot directly contact Joe Witt, but you already trust Andy LoPresto (i.e. you have verified Andy's key and believe Andy would verify keys he trusts), you can sign Joe's key if Andy has already done so. You can choose to employ a lower level of validity (`marginal` vs. `full`) in that case depending on your transitive **ownertrust** in Andy's verification. See [Web of Trust][web-of-trust] and [GNU Privacy Handbook][gnu-privacy-handbook] for more information and helpful diagrams. 

## <a name="set-up-git-with-your-key">Set up Git with your key</a>

To sign commits via `git`, update your `~/.gitconfig` file. You can also do this by running `git --config ...` commands. This example file (not complete) is configured for our *NiFi Test User <test@nifi.apache.org>* (`0x555DB64A`) user. 

```
# ~/.gitconfig
[user]
    name = NiFi Test User
    email = test@nifi.apache.org
    signingkey = 555DB64A
[commit]
    gpgsign = true
    template = /path/to/template/.stCommitMsg
[gpg]
    program = /path/to/bin/gpg
```

See [Telling Git About Your GPG Key][git-config-gpg] for more on setting this up. 

## <a name="sign-commits">Sign commits</a>

Now when you commit work via git, you will run the command `git commit -S` to tell git to sign the commit. After doing that, `git log --show-signature` will show the signature:

```

## <a name="verifying-a-signature">Verifying a signature</a>

When viewing commits by other authors, each may have a signature. The validity of the signature depends on your trust of the signer's key. 

*NOTE: sometimes, the __author__ and __signer__ of a commit are different, especially in NiFi's RTC context.* The *author* is who wrote the code/content in the change, while the *signer* is the *committer* who actually merged the code to the `master` branch. 

For example, I have imported and trust Matt's key but do not trust Bryan's key. Here are two commits, both *authored* by Matt, but one (`06e8f88`) he committed himself (thus also *signed* by his key), and one (`26ea785`) that Bryan commited for him (and *signed* with Bryan's key).

When signing a release artifact (an [RM duty][apache-nifi-release] only), you should generate detached GPG signatures (i.e. in a separate file, ASCII-armored (aka Base64-encoded)). These signatures should be named `file-being-signed.xyz.asc` and should be signed using the `SHA-512` hash algorithm. See [Configure GPG to always prefer stronger hashes](https://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#key-gen-avoid-sha1) to configure this preference permanently. 

 ```
        $ gpg -a -b --digest-algo=SHA512 nifi-${NIFI_VERSION}-source-release.zip  # produces nifi-${NIFI_VERSION}-source-release.zip.asc
        $ gpg -a -b --digest-algo=SHA512 nifi-${NIFI_VERSION}-bin.zip             # produces nifi-${NIFI_VERSION}-bin.zip.asc
        $ gpg -a -b --digest-algo=SHA512 nifi-toolkit-${NIFI_VERSION}-bin.zip     # produces nifi-toolkit-${NIFI_VERSION}-bin.zip.asc
 ```

The output looks like below:

```

## <a name="verifying-a-release-signature">Verifying a release signature</a>

For an official Apache NiFi release, the source release archive (*nifi-${NIFI_VERSION}-source-release.zip*) will be accompanied by multiple checksum files and a GPG signature. The user who generated the GPG signature (the Release Manager) will have specified the user ID (name and email) used to sign it, and will have ensured their public key is present in the `KEYS` file listed in the vote email. Following the steps in the email, download the `KEYS` file and import it into your GPG keyring (it may report that no keys changed if you already had all of the published keys imported). Refer to [Import another GPG key](#import-another-gpg-key) for more details if necessary. 

```

Refer to [Verify a key](#verify-a-key) for steps to verify the untrusted key if necessary. 

A bad (incorrect, modified, malicious) signature will have a result like:

```
# Verifying a bad signature

gpg: using pgp trust model
gpg: BAD signature from "Andy LoPresto <alopresto@apache.org>" [full]
gpg: binary signature, digest algorithm SHA512, key algorithm rsa4096
```

In this case, you should contact the RM and report this finding. 

## Troubleshooting

* IDE integration may require configuring `gpg` to use `no-tty` in `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`. See [Git GPG signing from IDE](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206502489-Git-GPG-commit-signing-commit-s-from-IDE-in-effective-way) or [How to sign git commits from within an IDE like IntelliJ?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46863981/how-to-sign-git-commits-from-within-an-ide-like-intellij).
