In this case, if the attribute is set to application/tar, the TAR Packaging Format will be used. If the attribute is set to application/zip, the ZIP Packaging Format will be used. If the attribute is set to application/flowfile-v3 or application/flowfile-v2 or application/flowfile-v1, the appropriate FlowFile Packaging Format will be used. If this attribute is missing, the FlowFile will be routed to 'failure'. Otherwise, if the attribute's value is not one of those mentioned above, the FlowFile will be routed to 'success' without being unpacked. Use the File Filter property only extract files matching a specific regular expression.</td></tr></table><h3>Writes Attributes: </h3><table id="writes-attributes"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>mime.type</td><td>If the FlowFile is successfully unpacked, its MIME Type is no longer known, so the mime.type attribute is set to application/octet-stream.</td></tr><tr><td>fragment.identifier</td><td>All unpacked FlowFiles produced from the same parent FlowFile will have the same randomly generated UUID added for this attribute</td></tr><tr><td>fragment.index</td><td>A one-up number that indicates the ordering of the unpacked FlowFiles that were created from a single parent FlowFile</td></tr><tr><td>fragment.count</td><td>The number of unpacked FlowFiles generated from the parent FlowFile</td></tr><tr><td>segment.original.filename </td><td>The filename of the parent FlowFile.
