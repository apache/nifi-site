<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
    This processor is designed to work with Gremlin and Cypher queries. The query is specified in the configuration parameter labeled
    Query, and parameters can be configured using dynamic properties on the processor. All Gremlin and Cypher CRUD operations are
    supported by this processor. It will stream the entire result set into a single flowfile as a JSON array.
