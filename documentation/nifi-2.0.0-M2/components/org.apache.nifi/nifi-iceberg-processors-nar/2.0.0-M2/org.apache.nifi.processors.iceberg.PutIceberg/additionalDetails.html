        <h1>PutIceberg</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Iceberg is a high-performance format for huge analytic tables.
            The PutIceberg processor is capable of pushing data into Iceberg tables using different types of Iceberg catalog implementations.
        </p>

        <h3>Commit retry properties</h3>
        <p>
            Iceberg supports multiple concurrent writes using optimistic concurrency.
            The processor's commit retry implementation is using <b>exponential backoff</b> with <b>jitter</b> and <b>scale factor 2</b>, and provides the following properties to configure the behaviour according to its usage.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Number Of Commit Retries (default: 10) - Number of retries that the processor is going to try to commit the new data files.
            </li>
            <li>
                Minimum Commit Wait Time (default: 100 ms) - Minimum time that the processor is going to wait before each commit attempt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximum Commit Wait Time (default: 2 sec) - Maximum time that the processor is going to wait before each commit attempt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximum Commit Duration (default: 30 sec) - Maximum duration that the processor is going to wait before failing the current processor event's commit.
            </li>
        </ul>

            The NiFi side retry logic is built on top of the Iceberg commit retry logic which can be configured through table properties. See more: <a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/#table-behavior-properties">Table behavior properties</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Snapshot summary properties</h3>
        <p>
            The processor provides an option to add additional properties to the snapshot summary using dynamic properties.
            The additional property must have the 'snapshot-property.' prefix in the dynamic property key but the actual entry will be inserted without it.
            Each snapshot automatically gets the FlowFile's uuid in the 'nifi-flowfile-uuid' summary property.
        </p>
