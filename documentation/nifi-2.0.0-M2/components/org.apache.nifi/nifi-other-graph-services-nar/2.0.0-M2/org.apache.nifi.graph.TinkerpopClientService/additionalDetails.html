<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
    This client service configures a connection to a Gremlin Server and allows Gremlin queries to be executed against
    the Gremlin Server. For more information on Gremlin and Gremlin Server, see the <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/">Apache Tinkerpop</a> project.
</p>

<p>
    This client service supports two differnt modes of operation: Script Submission and Bytecode Submission, described below.
</p>

<h2>Script Submission</h2>
<p>
    Script submission is the default way to interact with the gremlin server. This takes the input script and uses <a href="https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-go-scripts">Script Submission</a>
    to interact with the gremlin server. Because the script is shipped to the gremlin server as a string, only simple queries are recommended (count, path, etc)
    as there are no complex serializers available in this operation. This also means that NiFi will not be opinionated about what is returned, whatever the response from
    the tinkerpop server is, the response will be deserialized assuming common Java types. In the case of a Map return, the values
    will be returned as a record in the FlowFile response, in all other cases, the return of the query will be coerced into a
    Map with key "result" and value being the result of your script submission for that specific response.
</p>

<h3>Serialization Issues in Script Submission</h3>
<p>
    A common issue when creating Gremlin scripts for first time users is to accidentally return an unserializable object. Gremlin
    is a Groovy DSL and so it behaves like compiled Groovy including returning the last statement in the script. This is an example
    of a Gremlin script that could cause unexpected failures:
</p>
<pre>
    g.V().hasLabel("person").has("name", "John Smith").valueMap()
</pre>
<p>
    The <em>valueMap()</em> step is not directly serializable and will fail. To fix that you have two potential options:
</p>
<pre>
    //Return a Map
    g.V().hasLabel("person").has("name", "John Smith").valueMap().next()
</pre>
<p>
    Alternative:
</p>
<pre>
    g.V().hasLabel("person").has("name", "John Smith").valueMap()
    true //Return boolean literal
</pre>
<h2>Bytecode Submission</h2>
<p>
    Bytecode submission is the more flexible of the two submission method and will be much more performant in a production
    system. When combined with the Yaml connection settings and a custom jar, very complex graph queries can be run directly
    within the NiFi JVM, leveraging custom serializers to decrease serialization overhead.
</p>
<p>
    Instead of submitting a script to the gremlin server, requiring string serialization on both sides of the string result
    set, the groovy script is compiled within the NiFi JVM. This compiled script has the bindings of g (the GraphTraversalSource)
    and log (the NiFi logger) injected into the compiled code. Utilizing g, your result set is contained within NiFi and serialization
    should take care of the overhead of your responses drastically decreasing the likelihood of serialization errors.
</p>
<p>
    As the result returned cannot be known by NiFi to be a specific type, your groovy script <b>must</b> rerun a Map&lt;String, Object&gt;,
    otherwise the response will be ignored. Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
    Object results = g.V().hasLabel("person").has("name", "John Smith").valueMap().collect()
    [result: results]
</pre>
<p>
    This will break up your response objects into an array within your result key, allowing further processing within nifi
    if necessary.
