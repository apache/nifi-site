<h1>PutSnowflakeInternalStage</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    The PutSnowflakeInternalStage processor can upload a file to a Snowflake internal stage. Please note, that named stages needs to be created in your Snowflake account manually.
    See the documentation on how to set up an internal stage <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-local-file-system-create-stage.html">here</a>.
    The processor requires an upstream connection and the incoming FlowFiles' content will be uploaded to the stage. A unique file name is generated for the file's staged file name.
    While the processor may be used separately, it's recommended to connect it to a StartSnowflakeIngest processor so that the uploaded file can be piped into your Snowflake table.
