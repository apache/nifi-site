The results of those Regular Expressions are assigned to FlowFile Attributes.  Regular Expressions are entered by adding user-defined properties; the name of the property maps to the Attribute Name into which the result will be placed.  The attributes are generated differently based on the enabling of named capture groups.  If named capture groups are not enabled:  The first capture group, if any found, will be placed into that attribute name.But all capture groups, including the matching string sequence itself will also be provided at that attribute name with an index value provided, with the exception of a capturing group that is optional and does not match - for example, given the attribute name "regex" and expression "abc(def)?(g)" we would add an attribute "regex.1" with a value of "def" if the "def" matched. If the "def" did not match, no attribute named "regex.1" would be added but an attribute named "regex.2" with a value of "g" will be added regardless.If named capture groups are enabled:  Each named capture group, if found will be placed into the attributes name with the name provided.  If enabled the matching string sequence itself will be placed into the attribute name.  If multiple matches are enabled, and index will be applied after the first set of matches. The exception is a capturing group that is optional and does not match  For example, given the attribute name "regex" and expression "abc(?&lt;NAMED&gt;def)?(?&lt;NAMED-TWO&gt;g)"  we would add an attribute "regex.NAMED" with the value of "def" if the "def" matched.  We would   add an attribute "regex.NAMED-TWO" with the value of "g" if the "g" matched regardless.  The value of the property must be a valid Regular Expressions with one or more capturing groups. If named capture groups are enabled, all capture groups must be named.  If they are not, then the  processor configuration will fail validation.  If the Regular Expression matches more than once, only the first match will be used unless the property enabling repeating capture group is set to true. If any provided Regular Expression matches, the FlowFile(s) will be routed to 'matched'. If no provided Regular Expression matches, the FlowFile will be routed to 'unmatched' and no attributes will be applied to the FlowFile.</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>evaluate, extract, Text, Regular Expression, regex</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
