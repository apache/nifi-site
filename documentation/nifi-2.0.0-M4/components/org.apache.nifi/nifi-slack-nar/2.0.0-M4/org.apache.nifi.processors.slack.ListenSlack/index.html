The messages are written out in JSON format. Note that this Processor should be used to obtain real-time messages and commands from Slack and does not provide a mechanism for obtaining historical messages. The ConsumeSlack Processor should be used for an initial load of messages from a channel. See Usage / Additional Details for more information about how to configure this Processor and enable it to retrieve messages and commands from Slack.</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>slack, real-time, event, message, command, listen, receive, social media, team, text, unstructured</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
