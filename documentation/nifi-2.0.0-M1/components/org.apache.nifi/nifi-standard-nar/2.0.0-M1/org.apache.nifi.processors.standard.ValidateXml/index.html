By default, the XML is contained in the FlowFile content. If the 'XML Source Attribute' property is set, the XML to be validated is contained in the specified attribute. It is not recommended to use attributes to hold large XML documents; doing so could adversely affect system performance. Full schema validation is performed if the processor is configured with the XSD schema details. Otherwise, the only validation performed is to ensure the XML syntax is correct and well-formed, e.g. all opening tags are properly closed.</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>xml, schema, validation, xsd</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
