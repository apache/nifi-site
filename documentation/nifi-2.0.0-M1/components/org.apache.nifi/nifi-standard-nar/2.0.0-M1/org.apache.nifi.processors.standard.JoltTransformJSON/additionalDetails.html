<!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
<h2>Usage Information</h2>

<p>
    The Jolt utilities processing JSON are not not stream based therefore large JSON document
    transformation may consume large amounts of memory. Currently UTF-8 FlowFile content and Jolt specifications are supported.
    A specification can be defined using Expression Language where attributes can be referred either on the left or right hand side within the specification syntax.

    Custom Jolt Transformations (that implement the Transform interface) are supported.  Modules containing custom libraries which do not
    existing on the current class path can be included via the custom module directory property.

    <Strong>Note:</Strong> When configuring a processor if user selects of the Default transformation yet provides a
    Chain specification the system does not alert that the specification is invalid and and will produce failed flow files.
    This is a known issue identified within the Jolt library.
