The file is expected to be textual. Data is ingested only when a new line is encountered (carriage return or new-line character or combination). If the file to tail is periodically "rolled over", as is generally the case with log files, an optional Rolling Filename Pattern can be used to retrieve data from files that have rolled over, even if the rollover occurred while NiFi was not running (provided that the data still exists upon restart of NiFi). It is generally advisable to set the Run Schedule to a few seconds, rather than running with the default value of 0 secs, as this Processor will consume a lot of resources if scheduled very aggressively. At this time, this Processor does not support ingesting files that have been compressed when 'rolled over'.</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>tail, file, log, text, source</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.

This pattern supports wildcard characters * and ?, it also supports the notation ${filename} to specify a pattern based on the name of the file (without extension), and will assume that the files that have rolled over live in the same directory as the file being tailed. The same glob pattern will be used for all files.</td></tr><tr><td id="name">Post-Rollover Tail Period</td><td>Post-Rollover Tail Period</td><td id="default-value">0 sec</td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">When a file is rolled over, the processor will continue tailing the rolled over file until it has not been modified for this amount of time. This allows for another process to rollover a file, and then flush out any buffered data. Note that when this value is set, and the tailed file rolls over, the new file will not be tailed until the old file has not been modified for the configured amount of time. Additionally, when using this capability, in order to avoid data duplication, this period must be set longer than the Processor's Run Schedule, and the Processor must not be stopped after the file being tailed has been rolled over and before the data has been fully consumed. Otherwise, the data may be duplicated, as the entire file may be written out as the contents of a single FlowFile.</td></tr><tr><td id="name">Base directory</td><td>tail-base-directory</td><td></td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">Base directory used to look for files to tail.

(Note: Yielding may delay the processing of other files tailed by this processor, not just the one with the NUL character.) The purpose of this flag is to allow users to handle cases where reading a file may return temporary NUL values. NFS for example may send file contents out of order. In this case the missing parts are temporarily replaced by NUL values. CAUTION! If the file contains legitimate NUL values, setting this flag causes this processor to get stuck indefinitely. For this reason users should refrain from using this feature if they can help it and try to avoid having the target file on a file system where reads are unreliable.</td></tr><tr><td id="name">Line Start Pattern</td><td>Line Start Pattern</td><td></td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">A Regular Expression to match against the start of a log line.
