    <p>This processor executes a delete operation against one or more indices using the _delete_by_query handler. The
    query should be a valid Elasticsearch JSON DSL query (Lucene syntax is not supported). An example query:</p>
    <pre>
        {
            "query": {
                "match": {
                    "username.keyword": "john.smith"
                }
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <p>To delete all of the contents of an index, this could be used:</p>
    <pre>
        {
            "query": {
                "match_all": {}
            }
        }
    </pre>
</body>
