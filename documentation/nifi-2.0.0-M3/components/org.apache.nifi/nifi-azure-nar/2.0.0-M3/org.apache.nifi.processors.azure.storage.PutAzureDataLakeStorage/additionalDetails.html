<h3>File uploading and cleanup process in case of "Write and Rename" strategy</h3>

<h4>New file upload</h4>

<ol>
    <li>A temporary file is created with random prefix under the given path in '_nifitempdirectory'.</li>
    <li>Content is appended to temp file.</li>
    <li>Temp file is moved to the final destination directory and renamed to its original name.</li>
    <li>In case of appending or renaming failure, the temp file is deleted.</li>
    <li>In case of temporary file deletion failure, the temp file remains on the server.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Existing file upload</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Processors with "fail" conflict resolution strategy will direct the FlowFile to "Failure" relationship.</li>
    <li>Processors with "ignore" conflict resolution strategy will direct the FlowFile to "Success" relationship.</li>
    <li>Processors with "replace" conflict resolution strategy:</li>

    <ol>
        <li>A temporary file is created with random prefix under the given path in '_nifitempdirectory'.</li>
        <li>Content is appended to temp file.</li>
        <li>Temp file is moved to the final destination directory and renamed to its original name, the original file is overwritten.</li>
        <li>In case of appending or renaming failure, the temp file is deleted and the original file remains intact.</li>
        <li>In case of temporary file deletion failure, both temp file and original file remain on the server.</li>
