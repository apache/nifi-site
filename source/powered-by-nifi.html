This data is vaulted and exposed via data marts providing our data scientists and business partners a secured global view of our manufacturing processes.  For ingestion flows requiring higher performance transformations, we utilize the NiFi Site-to-Site protocol to seamlessly transfer processing to Spark jobs on our Hadoop clusters.  We have leveraged NiFi's REST API to automate the creation and monitoring of new ingestion pipelines which furthers our goal of providing a complete Global Data Warehouse.</td>
