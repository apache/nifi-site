### MiNiFi Java
The Java agent is built from the same codebase as NiFi, enabling it to run most of [NiFi's processors](http://nifi.apache.org/docs.html).
However, it results in a larger binary distribution, consumes greater system resources, and requires JRE, compared to MiNiFi C++.
If you require maximum flexibility to make routing and processing decisions at your data's point of origin, the Java agent is a good fit.
