# MiNiFi C++ Quick Start

## Overview

Apache NiFi - MiNiFi C++ is a complementary data collection approach that supplements the core tenets of NiFi in dataflow management, focusing on the collection of data at the source of its creation. The C++ implementation is an additional implementation to the one in Java with the aim of an even smaller resource footprint.

Specific goals for MiNiFi comprise:

- small and lightweight footprint
- central management of agents
- generation of data provenance
- integration with NiFi for follow-on dataflow management and full chain of custody of information 

Perspectives of the role of MiNiFi should be from the perspective of the agent acting immediately at, or directly adjacent to, source sensors, systems, or servers.
