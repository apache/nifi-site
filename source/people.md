# Apache <span class="ni">ni</span><span class="fi">fi</span> Team

A successful project requires many people to play many roles. Some members write code, provide project mentorship,
or author documentation. Others are valuable as testers, submitting patches and suggestions.

The team consists of Project Management Committee Members, Committers, and Contributors.

Committers are the group of volunteers who are responsible for the technical aspects of the Apache NiFi Project.
This group has write access to the appropriate source repositories. All committer input is valued and when technical
discussions occur, committer input is treated the same as PMC member input. Committers are encouraged to vote on
releases and technical discussions, but only PMC members may cast "binding" votes
see [Apache Voting Guide](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html#binding-votes).
Membership as a Committer is by invitation only and must be approved by
[consensus approval](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#ConsensusApproval) of the active Apache
NiFi PMC members on a vote open for at least 72 hours. A Committer is considered inactive by their own declaration or by
not contributing in any form to the project for over six months. An inactive member can become active again by reversing
whichever condition made them inactive ( i.e., by reversing their earlier declaration or by once again contributing
toward the project's work). Membership can be revoked by a unanimous vote of all the active PMC members (except the
member in question if they are a PMC member).

Contributors improve the project through submission of patches and suggestions. The number of Contributors to the
project is unbounded. Get involved today. All contributions to the project are greatly appreciated.

Emeritus members are those that served as PMC members or committers and who have since moved into non-active status.
Their contributions and efforts are greatly appreciated in helping the community develop.
