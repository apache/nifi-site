If you configure a very small Time Duration, then the accuracy of the throttle gets worse. You can improve this accuracy by decreasing the Yield Duration, at the expense of more Tasks given to the processor.</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>rate control, throttle, rate, throughput</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any default values.</p><table id="properties"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Default Value</th><th>Allowable Values</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td id="name"><strong>Rate Control Criteria</strong></td><td id="default-value">data rate</td><td id="allowable-values"><ul><li>data rate <img src="../../../../../html/images/iconInfo.png" alt="Rate is controlled by counting bytes transferred per time duration." title="Rate is controlled by counting bytes transferred per time duration."></img></li><li>flowfile count <img src="../../../../../html/images/iconInfo.png" alt="Rate is controlled by counting flowfiles transferred per time duration" title="Rate is controlled by counting flowfiles transferred per time duration"></img></li><li>attribute value <img src="../../../../../html/images/iconInfo.png" alt="Rate is controlled by accumulating the value of a specified attribute that is transferred per time duration" title="Rate is controlled by accumulating the value of a specified attribute that is transferred per time duration"></img></li></ul></td><td id="description">Indicates the criteria that is used to control the throughput rate. Changing this value resets the rate counters.</td></tr><tr><td id="name"><strong>Maximum Rate</strong></td><td></td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">The maximum rate at which data should pass through this processor. The format of this property is expected to be a positive integer, or a Data Size (such as '1 MB') if Rate Control Criteria is set to 'data rate'.</td></tr><tr><td id="name">Rate Controlled Attribute</td><td></td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">The name of an attribute whose values build toward the rate limit if Rate Control Criteria is set to 'attribute value'. The value of the attribute referenced by this property must be a positive long, or the FlowFile will be routed to failure. This value is ignored if Rate Control Criteria is not set to 'attribute value'. Changing this value resets the rate counters.</td></tr><tr><td id="name"><strong>Time Duration</strong></td><td id="default-value">1 min</td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">The amount of time to which the Maximum Rate pertains. Changing this value resets the rate counters.</td></tr><tr><td id="name">Grouping Attribute</td><td></td><td id="allowable-values"></td><td id="description">By default, a single "throttle" is used for all FlowFiles. If this value is specified, a separate throttle is used for each value specified by the attribute with this name. Changing this value resets the rate counters.</td></tr></table><h3>Relationships: </h3><table id="relationships"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>success</td><td>FlowFiles are transferred to this relationship under normal conditions</td></tr><tr><td>failure</td><td>FlowFiles will be routed to this relationship if they are missing a necessary Rate Controlled Attribute or the attribute is not in the expected format</td></tr></table><h3>Reads Attributes: </h3>None specified.<h3>Writes Attributes: </h3>None specified.<h3>State management: </h3>This component does not store state.<h3>Restricted: </h3>This component is not restricted.<h3>Input requirement: </h3>This component requires an incoming relationship.<h3>System Resource Considerations:</h3>None specified.</body></html>
