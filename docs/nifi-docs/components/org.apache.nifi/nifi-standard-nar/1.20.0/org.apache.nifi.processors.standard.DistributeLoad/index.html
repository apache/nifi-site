If using the Round Robin strategy, the default is to assign each destination a weighting of 1 (evenly distributed). However, optional propertiescan be added to the change this; adding a property with the name '5' and value '10' means that the relationship with name '5' will be receive 10 FlowFiles in each iteration instead of 1.</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>distribute, load balance, route, round robin, weighted</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
