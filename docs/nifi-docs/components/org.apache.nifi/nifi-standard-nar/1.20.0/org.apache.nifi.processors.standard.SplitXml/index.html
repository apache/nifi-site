A depth of 1 means split the root's children, whereas a depth of 2 means split the root's children's children and so forth.</td></tr></table><h3>Relationships: </h3><table id="relationships"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>failure</td><td>If a FlowFile fails processing for any reason (for example, the FlowFile is not valid XML), it will be routed to this relationship</td></tr><tr><td>original</td><td>The original FlowFile that was split into segments. If the FlowFile fails processing, nothing will be sent to this relationship</td></tr><tr><td>split</td><td>All segments of the original FlowFile will be routed to this relationship</td></tr></table><h3>Reads Attributes: </h3>None specified.<h3>Writes Attributes: </h3><table id="writes-attributes"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>fragment.identifier</td><td>All split FlowFiles produced from the same parent FlowFile will have the same randomly generated UUID added for this attribute</td></tr><tr><td>fragment.index</td><td>A one-up number that indicates the ordering of the split FlowFiles that were created from a single parent FlowFile</td></tr><tr><td>fragment.count</td><td>The number of split FlowFiles generated from the parent FlowFile</td></tr><tr><td>segment.original.filename </td><td>The filename of the parent FlowFile</td></tr></table><h3>State management: </h3>This component does not store state.<h3>Restricted: </h3>This component is not restricted.<h3>Input requirement: </h3>This component requires an incoming relationship.<h3>System Resource Considerations:</h3><table id="system-resource-considerations"><tr><th>Resource</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>MEMORY</td><td>The entirety of the FlowFile's content (as a Document object) is read into memory, in addition to all of the generated FlowFiles representing the split XML. A Document object can take approximately 10 times as much memory as the size of the XML. For example, a 1 MB XML document may use 10 MB of memory. If many splits are generated due to the size of the XML, a two-phase approach may be necessary to avoid excessive use of memory.</td></tr></table></body></html>
