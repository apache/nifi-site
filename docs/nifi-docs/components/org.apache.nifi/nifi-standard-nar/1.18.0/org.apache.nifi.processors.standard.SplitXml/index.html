A depth of 1 means split the root's children, whereas a depth of 2 means split the root's children's children and so forth.</td></tr></table><h3>Relationships: </h3><table id="relationships"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>failure</td><td>If a FlowFile fails processing for any reason (for example, the FlowFile is not valid XML), it will be routed to this relationship</td></tr><tr><td>original</td><td>The original FlowFile that was split into segments.

A Document object can take approximately 10 times as much memory as the size of the XML. For example, a 1 MB XML document may use 10 MB of memory. If many splits are generated due to the size of the XML, a two-phase approach may be necessary to avoid excessive use of memory.</td></tr></table></body></html>
