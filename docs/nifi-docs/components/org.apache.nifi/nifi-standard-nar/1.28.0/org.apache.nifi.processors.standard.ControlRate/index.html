If you configure a very small Time Duration, then the accuracy of the throttle gets worse. You can improve this accuracy by decreasing the Yield Duration, at the expense of more Tasks given to the processor.</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>rate control, throttle, rate, throughput</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
