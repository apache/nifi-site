Processors' stats are logged using the org.apache.nifi.controller.ControllerStatusReportingTask.Processors logger, while Connections' stats are logged using the org.apache.nifi.controller.ControllerStatusReportingTask.Connections logger. These can be configured in the NiFi logging configuration to log to different files, if desired.</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>stats, log</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
