Each incoming FlowFile will be cloned. The original FlowFile will have appropriate attributes added and then be transferred to the 'original' relationship. The clone will have appropriate attributes added and then be routed to the 'enrichment' relationship. See the documentation for the JoinEnrichment processor (and especially its Additional Details) for more information on how these Processors work together and how to perform enrichment tasks in NiFi by using these Processors.</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>fork, join, enrich, record</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>This component has no required or optional properties.</p><h3>Relationships: </h3><table id="relationships"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>enrichment</td><td>A clone of the incoming FlowFile will be routed to this relationship, after adding appropriate attributes.</td></tr><tr><td>original</td><td>The incoming FlowFile will be routed to this relationship, after adding appropriate attributes.</td></tr></table><h3>Reads Attributes: </h3>None specified.<h3>Writes Attributes: </h3><table id="writes-attributes"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>enrichment.group.id</td><td>The Group ID to use in order to correlate the 'original' FlowFile with the 'enrichment' FlowFile.</td></tr><tr><td>enrichment.role</td><td>The role to use for enrichment.
