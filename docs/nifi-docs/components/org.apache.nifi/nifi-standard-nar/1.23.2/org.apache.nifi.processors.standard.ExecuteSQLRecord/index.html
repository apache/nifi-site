Query result will be converted to the format specified by a Record Writer. Streaming is used so arbitrarily large result sets are supported. This processor can be scheduled to run on a timer, or cron expression, using the standard scheduling methods, or it can be triggered by an incoming FlowFile. If it is triggered by an incoming FlowFile, then attributes of that FlowFile will be available when evaluating the select query, and the query may use the ? to escape parameters. In this case, the parameters to use must exist as FlowFile attributes with the naming convention sql.args.N.type and sql.args.N.value, where N is a positive integer. The sql.args.N.type is expected to be a number indicating the JDBC Type. The content of the FlowFile is expected to be in UTF-8 format. FlowFile attribute 'executesql.row.count' indicates how many rows were selected.</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>sql, select, jdbc, query, database, record</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.

However, for some JDBC drivers such as PostgreSQL driver, it is required to disable the auto committing functionality to limit the number of result rows fetching at a time. When auto commit is enabled, postgreSQL driver loads whole result set to memory at once. This could lead for a large amount of memory usage when executing queries which fetch large data sets. More Details of this behaviour in PostgreSQL driver can be found in https://jdbc.postgresql.org//documentation/head/query.html. </td></tr></table><h3>Dynamic Properties: </h3><p>Supports Sensitive Dynamic Properties: <strong>Yes</strong></p><p>Dynamic Properties allow the user to specify both the name and value of a property.<table id="dynamic-properties"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td id="name">sql.args.N.type</td><td id="value">SQL type argument to be supplied</td><td>Incoming FlowFiles are expected to be parametrized SQL statements.
