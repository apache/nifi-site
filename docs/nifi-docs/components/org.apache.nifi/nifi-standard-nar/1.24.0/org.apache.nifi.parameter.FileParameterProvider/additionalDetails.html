    <h3>Deriving Parameters from Files</h3>

    <p>
        The FileParameterProvider maps a directory to a parameter group named after the directory, and the files
        within the directory to parameters.  Each file's name is mapped to a parameter, and the content of the file
        becomes the value.  Hidden files and nested directories are ignored.
    </p>

    <p>
        While this provider can be useful in a range of cases, it particularly matches the mounted volume secret
        structure in Kubernetes.  A full discussion of Kubernetes secrets is beyond the scope of this document,
        but a brief overview can illustrate how these secrets can be mapped to parameter groups.
    </p>

    <h3>Kubernetes Mounted Secrets Example</h3>

    <p>
        Assume a secret is configured as follows:

        <pre>
data:
  admin_username: my-username (base64-encoded)
  admin_password: my-password (base64-encoded)
  access_key: my-key (base64-encoded)
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Assume a deployment has the following configuration:

        <pre>
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: system-credentials
    secret:
      items:
      - key: admin_username
        path: sys.admin.username
      - key: admin_password
        path: sys.admin.password
      - key: access_key
        path: sys.access.key
      secretName: system-creds
  containers:
  - volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /etc/secrets/system-credentials
      name: system-credentials
      readOnly: true
        </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, this secret will appear on disk as follows:

        <pre>
$ ls /etc/secrets/system-credentials
sys.access.key  sys.admin.password sys.admin.username
        </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore, to map this secret to a parameter group that will populate a Parameter Context named 'system-credentials',
        you should simply provide the following configuration to the FileParameterProvider:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Parameter Group Directories</b> - /etc/secrets/system-credentials</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The 'system-credentials' parameter context will then contain the following parameters:

        <ul>
            <li><b>sys.access.key</b> - my-key</li>
            <li><b>sys.admin.username</b> - my-username</li>
            <li><b>sys.admin.password</b> - my-password</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
