<h2>Sniffing</h2>
<p>
    The Elasticsearch Sniffer can be used to locate Elasticsearch Nodes within a Cluster to which you are connecting.
    This can be beneficial if your cluster dynamically changes over time, e.g. new Nodes are added to maintain performance during heavy load.
</p>
<p>
    Sniffing can also be used to update the list of Hosts within the Cluster if a connection Failure is encountered during operation.
    In order to "Sniff on Failure", you <b>must</b> also enable "Sniff Cluster Nodes".
</p>
<p>
    Not all situations make sense to use Sniffing, for example if:
    <ul>
        <li>Elasticsearch is situated behind a load balancer, which dynamically routes connections from NiFi</li>
        <li>Elasticsearch is on a different network to NiFi</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    There may also be need to set some of the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-network.html">
    Elasticsearch Networking Advanced Settings</a>, such as <code>network.publish_host</code> to ensure that
    the HTTP Hosts found by the Sniffer are accessible by NiFi. For example, Elasticsearch may use a network internal
    <code>publish_host</code> that is inaccessible to NiFi, but instead should use an address/IP that NiFi understands.
    It may also be necessary to add this same address to Elasticsearch's <code>network.bind_host</code> list.
