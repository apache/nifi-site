	<h2>Configuration Details</h2>
	<h3>Object Key</h3>
	<p>The Object Key property value should not start with "/".</p>
	<h3>Credentials File</h3>
    <p>The Credentials File property allows the user to specify the path to a file containing the AWS access key and secret key. The contents of the file should be in the following format:</p>
    <pre>
        [default]
		accessKey=&lt;access key&gt;
		secretKey=&lt;security key&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>Make sure the credentials file is readable by the NiFi service user.</p>
    <p>When using the Credential File property, ensure that there are no values for the Access Key and Secret Key properties.  The Value column should read "No value set" for both.  <b>Note:</b> Do not check "Set empty string" for either as the empty string is considered a set value.</p>
