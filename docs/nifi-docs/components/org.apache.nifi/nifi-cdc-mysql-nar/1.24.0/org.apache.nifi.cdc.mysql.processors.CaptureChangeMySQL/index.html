CDC Events include INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations. Events are output as either a group of a specified number of events (the default is 1 so each event becomes its own flow file) or grouped as a full transaction (BEGIN to COMMIT). All events are ordered by the time at which the operation occurred. NOTE: If the processor is stopped before the specified number of events have been written to a flow file, the partial flow file will be output in order to maintain the consistency of the event stream.</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>sql, jdbc, cdc, mysql, transaction, event</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
