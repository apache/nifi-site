To add a query, add a new property to the processor. The name of the property will become a new relationship for the processor, and the value is an HL7 Query Language query. If a FlowFile matches the query, a copy of the FlowFile will be routed to the associated relationship.</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>HL7, healthcare, route, Health Level 7</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
