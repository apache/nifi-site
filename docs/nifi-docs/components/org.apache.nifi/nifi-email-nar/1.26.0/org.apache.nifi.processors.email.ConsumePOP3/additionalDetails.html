	<!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
	<h2>Description:</h2>
	<p>This Processor consumes email messages via POP3 protocol and sends the content of an email message as content of the Flow File. 
	   Content of the incoming email message is written as raw bytes to the content of the outgoing Flow File.
    </p>

	<p>Since different serves may require different Java Mail
		properties such properties could be provided via dynamic properties.
		For example, below is a sample configuration for GMail:
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Processor's static properties:</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Host Name</b> - pop.gmail.com</li>
			<li><b>Port</b> - 995</li>
			<li><b>User Name</b> - <i>[your user name]</i></li>
			<li><b>Password</b> - <i>[your password]</i></li>
			<li><b>Folder</b> - INBOX</li>
		</ul>
		<b>Processor's dynamic properties:</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>mail.pop3.socketFactory.class</b> - javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory</li>
			<li><b>mail.pop3.socketFactory.fallback</b> - false</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	Another useful property is	<b>mail.debug</b> which allows Java Mail API to print protocol messages to the console helping you to both understand what's going on as well as debug issues.
	</p>
	<p>
