    <p>This processor is intended for use with the Elasticsearch JSON DSL and Elasticsearch 5.X and newer. It is designed
    to be able to take a JSON query (e.g. from Kibana) and execute it as-is against an Elasticsearch cluster in a paginated manner.
    Like all processors in the "restapi" bundle, it uses the official Elastic client APIs, so it supports leader detection.</p>
    <p>The query JSON to execute can be provided either in the Query configuration property or in the content of the flowfile.
    If the Query Attribute property is configured, the executed query JSON will be placed in the attribute provided by this property.</p>
    <p>The query is paginated in Elasticsearch using one of the available methods - "Scroll" or "Search After" (optionally
    with a "Point in Time" for Elasticsearch 7.10+ with XPack enabled). The number of results per page can be controlled using
        the <em>size</em> parameter in the Query JSON. For Search After functionality, a <em>sort</em> parameter <strong>must</strong>
    be present within the Query JSON.</p>
    <p>Search results and aggregation results can be split up into multiple flowfiles. Aggregation results
    will only be split at the top level because nested aggregations lose their context (and thus lose their value) if
    separated from their parent aggregation. Additionally, the results from all pages can be combined into a single
    flowfile (but the processor will only load each page of data into memory at any one time).</p>
    <p>The following is an example query that would be accepted:</p>
    <pre>
        {
            "query": {
                "size": 10000,
                "sort": {"product": "desc"},
                "match": {
                    "restaurant.keyword": "Local Pizzaz FTW Inc"
                }
            },
            "aggs": {
                "weekly_sales": {
                  "date_histogram": {
                    "field": "date",
                    "interval": "week"
                  },
                  "aggs": {
                    "items": {
                      "terms": {
                        "field": "product",
                        "size": 10
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
            }
        }
    </pre>
