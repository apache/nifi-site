The ISP data is provided as a MaxMind ISP database. (Note that this is NOT the same as the GeoLite database utilized by some geo enrichment tools). The attribute that contains the IP address to lookup is provided by the 'IP Address Attribute' property. If the name of the attribute provided is 'X', then the the attributes added by enrichment will take the form X.isp.&lt;fieldName&gt;</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>ISP, enrich, ip, maxmind</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
