<h2>Usage Example</h2>
<p>
    This processor streams the contents of a FlowFile to an Apache Solr
    update handler. Any properties added to this processor by the user are
    passed to Solr on the update request. If a parameter must be sent multiple
    times with different values, properties can follow a naming convention:
    name.number, where name is the parameter name and number is a unique number.
    Repeating parameters will be sorted by their property name.
</p>
<p>
    Example: To specify multiple 'f' parameters for indexing custom json, the following
    properties can be defined:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>split</strong>: /exams</li>
    <li><strong>f.1</strong>: first:/first</li>
    <li><strong>f.2</strong>: last:/last</li>
    <li><strong>f.3</strong>: grade:/grade</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This will result in sending the following url to Solr: </br>
    split=/exams&f=first:/first&f=last:/last&f=grade:/grade
</p>
