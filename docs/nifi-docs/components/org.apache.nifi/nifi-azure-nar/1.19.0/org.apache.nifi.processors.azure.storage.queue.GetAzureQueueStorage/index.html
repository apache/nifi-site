The retrieved messages will be deleted from the queue by default. If the requirement is to consume messages without deleting them, set 'Auto Delete Messages' to 'false'. Note: There might be chances of receiving duplicates in situations like when a message is received but was unable to be deleted from the queue due to some unexpected situations.</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>azure, queue, microsoft, storage, dequeue, cloud</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
