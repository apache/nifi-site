There are certain risks in allowing the account name to be stored as a flowfile attribute. While it does provide for a more flexible flow by allowing the account name to be fetched dynamically from a flowfile attribute, care must be taken to restrict access to the event provenance data (e.g., by strictly controlling the policies governing provenance for this processor).

Override this endpoint suffix with a different suffix in certain circumstances (like Azure Stack or non-public Azure regions). The preferred way is to configure them through a controller service specified in the Storage Credentials property. The controller service can provide a common/shared configuration for multiple/all Azure processors. Furthermore, the credentials can also be looked up dynamically with the 'Lookup' version of the service.<br/><strong>Supports Expression Language: true (will be evaluated using flow file attributes and variable registry)</strong></td></tr></table><h3>State management: </h3>This component does not store state.<h3>Restricted: </h3>This component is not restricted.<h3>System Resource Considerations:</h3>None specified.</body></html>
