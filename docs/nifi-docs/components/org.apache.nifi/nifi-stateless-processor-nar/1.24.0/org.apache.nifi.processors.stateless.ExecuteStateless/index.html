Please see documentation in order to understand the differences between the traditional NiFi runtime engine and the Stateless NiFi engine. If the Processor is configured with an incoming connection, the incoming FlowFiles will be queued up into the specified Input Port in the dataflow. Data that is transferred out of the flow via an Output Port will be sent to the 'output' relationship, and an attribute will be added to indicate which Port that FlowFile was transferred to. See Additional Details for more information.</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>No tags provided.</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
